  details: |
    Coming from a background in applied mathematics, throughout my experiences, I have always kept this taste to be at the interface between numerical methodologies, technologies used and the problems and questions of all scientific communities. The main places that translate this orientation are training and technical and scientific animation, expertise (within projects, through software developments) around scientific computing and research data management, and technical and methodological support to the use of complex digital platforms.
